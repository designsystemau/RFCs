# Rename design system to GOLD

I propose that we rename "Australian Government Design System" to "GOLD Design System", where GOLD is an acronym for "Government Open Language for Design". I also propose we rename "Design System AU" to "Design System Au", where "u" in "Au" is lower case as that the atomic label representing the element gold. I think this is makes the connection between the org naming and DS naming clearer and more logical.

I propose that we do this as it was the original name of the system, as can be seen in this [CSS Tricks tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/css/status/970805659842134016) and the [original docs site](https://trevorbrennan.com/cv/gold).

I am aware this is supported by @dominikwilkowski for different reasons, mentioned [in his Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/wilkowskidom/status/1426350990446399490?s=20). Dominik argues that having a fun name (as opposed to a plain language name) has the effect of "creating shared language" and is better to "excite people about working together", particularly non-technical people. That this is beneficial for "creating unity and delight" and gives your people an identity. Further, that not taking a project in a light-hearted way ("not too seriously") is "an important part to make yourself #accessible".

Building on this, in light of the end of an era of DTA custodianship, I believe this would be an appropriate identity change to reignite the community.

There is a counter argument for leaving the name as "Australian Government Design System" or "AuDS" because it is more clear, and people know what it is.

However, both are authentic names for the system.

Also, and finally, everyone loved the name "GOLD".

## A short description of the desired outcome or solution

This would require:

- to update all references of "Australian Government Design System" to "GOLD Design System"
- to update of all references of "AuDS" to "GOLD"
- Other branding updates
- A Press Release or Blog post indicating this has occurred
- Rename npm handle to `@gold.au` 
- Update casing of org from `Design System AU` to `Design System Au`

This would **not** require:

- Github org and organisation remain named `Design System Au`
