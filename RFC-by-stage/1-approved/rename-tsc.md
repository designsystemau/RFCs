# Rename TSC to SC

## The issue to be solved

Brigitta Norton brought the suggestion to rename TSC to SC or Steering Committee, "to take into account design and other aspects".

There has been some discussion about this in #tsc on Slack and general consensus.

In support of the change, Jordan Hatch added - "lots of non-'technical' aspects to consider in the Design System and many people wonâ€™t understand the TSC extends to those too".

In support of the change, Matt Sawkill added - "agree that design, content, etc are technical roles and we'd love to have them, but those folks are just as likely to be influenced by the industry to not think of themselves that way".

## A short description of the desired outcome or solution

- Rename all references of "TSC" to the expanded "Steering Committee"

## Technical details

- repo renaming
- update references on blog
- slack group renaming
